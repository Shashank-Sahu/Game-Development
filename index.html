                <p>
                    CryEngine (officially stylized as CRYENGINE) is a game engine designed by the German game developer
                    Crytek. It has been used in all of their titles with the initial version being used in Far Cry, and
                    continues to be updated to support new consoles and hardware for their games. It has also been used
                    for many third-party games under Crytek's licensing scheme, including Sniper: Ghost Warrior 2 and
                    SNOW. Warhorse Studios uses a modified version of the engine for their medieval RPG Kingdom Come:
                    Deliverance. Ubisoft maintains an in-house, heavily modified version of CryEngine from the original
                    Far Cry called the Dunia Engine, which is used in their later iterations of the Far Cry series.

                                architecture of the level to complete the puzzle.</p>
